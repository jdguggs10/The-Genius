    //     // 1. Navigate to the chat view where the input bar is visible
    //     //    (e.g., tap on a conversation if needed, or ensure one is selected by default)
    //     //    Example: If conversations are listed in a table:
    //     //    app.tables.cells.firstMatch.tap()
    //
    //     // 2. Tap the "+" button to bring up the PhotosPicker
    //     //    Need to ensure the button has an accessibility identifier.
    //     //    Let's assume it's "addAttachmentButton" for this example.
    //     //    app.buttons["addAttachmentButton"].tap()
    //
    //     // 3. !! This is the challenging part: Interacting with PhotosPicker in UI tests !!
    //     // System pickers run in a separate process and are difficult to control directly
    //     // from your app's UI tests.
    //     // - One approach is to use the PhotosUI test support if available and applicable.
    //     // - Another is to mock the photo selection mechanism if the view model or relevant logic
    //     //   can be injected with a mock photo provider for testing purposes.
    //     // - Directly interacting with the system PhotosPicker UI is fragile and often
    //     //   relies on screen coordinates or trying to find elements by label/text, which can
    //     //   change with iOS versions or localization.
    //     //
    //     // For this outlined test, we'll describe the ideal verification steps,
    //     // acknowledging the difficulty in automating step 3.
    //
    //     // (Assuming photos have been programmatically "selected" or the picker interaction is handled)
    //
    //     // 4. After photos are (assumed to be) selected, verify the preview area appears.
    //     //    The preview area (ScrollView) would need an accessibility identifier.
    //     //    Let's assume "attachmentPreviewScrollView".
    //     // let attachmentPreviewScrollView = app.scrollViews["attachmentPreviewScrollView"]
    //     // XCTAssertTrue(attachmentPreviewScrollView.waitForExistence(timeout: 5), "Attachment preview scroll view should appear.")
    //
    //     // 5. Verify that there are image previews within the scroll view.
    //     //    This assumes the images within the preview also have an accessibility trait or identifier.
    //     // XCTAssertGreaterThan(attachmentPreviewScrollView.images.count, 0, "There should be at least one image preview.")
    //     //
    //     // Example: If each preview image has an identifier like "previewImage_0", "previewImage_1"
    //     // let firstPreviewImage = attachmentPreviewScrollView.images["previewImage_0"]
    //     // XCTAssertTrue(firstPreviewImage.exists, "First preview image should exist.")
