# ESPN Fantasy Baseball Transaction Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

Based on the debug report, several critical issues were identified and fixed in the ESPN Fantasy Baseball MCP server:

### 1. Timestamp Conversion Issues

**Problem**: Activity dates were returned as raw millisecond timestamps instead of human-readable dates.

**Fix**: Added `convert_timestamp()` function in `utils.py` that:
- Converts ESPN millisecond timestamps to readable date strings
- Handles invalid/future timestamps gracefully
- Provides fallback error messages for debugging
- Preserves raw timestamp for debugging purposes

**Files Modified**: `utils.py` (lines 29-56, 280-282)

### 2. Null Comparison Errors in Draft Functions

**Problem**: Sorting operations failed when `overall_pick`, `round_pick`, or other numeric fields were `None`.

**Fix**: Updated all sorting operations to use null-safe comparisons:
- Changed `p.get("overall_pick", 0)` to `p.get("overall_pick", 0) or 0`
- Applied to all draft sorting functions

**Files Modified**: `draft.py` (lines 48, 80, 115, 289)

### 3. Null Value Handling in Pick Serialization

**Problem**: `pick_to_dict()` function didn't handle null values properly, causing downstream errors.

**Fix**: Enhanced `pick_to_dict()` function with:
- Explicit null checking for all numeric fields
- Default values (0) for null numeric fields
- Better error handling with structured error responses
- Null-safe team and player object handling

**Files Modified**: `utils.py` (lines 498-530)

### 4. Enhanced Error Logging and Debugging

**Problem**: Limited visibility into what was happening during API calls and data processing.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the transaction processing:
- Detailed logging in `get_recent_activity()` function
- Sample activity logging for debugging
- Enhanced error messages with context
- Activity processing counters and status updates

**Files Modified**: `transactions.py` (lines 32-85, 87-110)

### 5. Year Detection Logic

**Problem**: Incorrect year detection for baseball seasons, especially in early months.

**Fix**: Improved year detection logic:
- If current month is before March, use previous year
- Added logging for auto-detected years
- Better handling of off-season periods

**Files Modified**: `utils.py` (lines 85-91)

### 6. Activity Processing Error Handling

**Problem**: Individual activity processing errors would cause entire requests to fail.

**Fix**: Added graceful error handling:
- Individual activity errors are logged but don't stop processing
- Error activities are included in results for debugging
- Enhanced debugging information for failed activities

**Files Modified**: `transactions.py` (lines 87-110)

## Testing

A debug script has been created to test the fixes:

```bash
python espn-api-util/debug_transaction_fix.py
```

This script will:
- Test the recent activity endpoint
- Show detailed debugging information
- Display processed activity data
- Help identify any remaining issues

## Key Improvements

1. **Robustness**: The system now handles null values and API errors gracefully
2. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify issues quickly
3. **Data Quality**: Timestamps are properly converted and displayed
4. **Error Recovery**: Individual failures don't crash the entire system
5. **Year Handling**: Better logic for determining the correct baseball season year

## Files Modified

- `espn-api-util/baseball_mcp/utils.py`
- `espn-api-util/baseball_mcp/transactions.py`
- `espn-api-util/baseball_mcp/draft.py`
- `espn-api-util/debug_transaction_fix.py` (new)

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes with your actual league data
2. Run the debug script to verify functionality
3. Monitor the stderr logs for any remaining issues
4. Consider adding more specific error handling based on real-world usage

The fixes address the core issues identified in the debug report while maintaining backward compatibility and adding better error handling throughout the system.
