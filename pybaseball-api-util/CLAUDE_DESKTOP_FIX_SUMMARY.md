# Claude Desktop PyBaseball MCP Server Fix Summary

## Problem
Claude Desktop was not loading the PyBaseball MCP server functions despite the configuration appearing correct.

## Root Cause
The issue was **global stdout redirection** in the MCP server code that was breaking the JSON-RPC communication protocol.

### What Was Happening
1. The server code had this problematic section:
```python
# Redirect stdout to stderr in MCP mode to prevent JSON parsing issues
if os.environ.get("MCP_STDIO_MODE") == "1":
    # Create a custom stdout that redirects to stderr
    class StderrRedirect:
        def write(self, text):
            sys.stderr.write(text)
            sys.stderr.flush()
        def flush(self):
            sys.stderr.flush()
    
    # Replace stdout with stderr redirect
    sys.stdout = StderrRedirect()
```

2. This redirection was intended to prevent PyBaseball output from contaminating the MCP JSON protocol
3. However, it also redirected **all** stdout, including the MCP server's JSON responses
4. Claude Desktop was sending initialization requests but never receiving responses
5. The server would timeout and Claude Desktop would not load the functions

## The Fix

### âœ… Removed Global Stdout Redirection
- Removed the global `sys.stdout` redirection that was breaking MCP communication
- The MCP protocol **requires** JSON responses to be sent via stdout
- PyBaseball output suppression is now handled at the function level only

### âœ… Updated Startup Script
- Fixed the startup script to point to the correct server file (`pybaseball_mcp_server_v2.py`)
- Added proper dependency verification
- Improved error handling and logging

### âœ… Upgraded MCP Library
- Upgraded from MCP 1.1.2 to 1.9.1 for better protocol support
- Added graceful handling of cancellation notifications

## Testing Results

### âœ… Server Communication Test
```
MCP Stdio Server Debug Test
========================================
Testing MCP stdio server...
âœ… Server started and is running
âœ… Server initialized: pybaseball-stats
âœ… Got 8 tools
  - player_stats
  - player_recent_performance
  - search_players
ðŸŽ‰ Server test passed!
```

### âœ… Startup Script Test
```
Starting PyBaseball MCP Server...
Virtual environment activated successfully
Starting MCP server in stdio mode...
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05",...}}
```

## Available Tools
The PyBaseball MCP server now provides these 8 tools to Claude Desktop:

1. **player_stats** - Get season statistics for MLB players
2. **player_recent_performance** - Get recent game performance  
3. **search_players** - Search for players by name
4. **mlb_standings** - Get current MLB standings
5. **stat_leaders** - Get league leaders for specific statistics
6. **team_statistics** - Get team aggregate statistics
7. **clear_stats_cache** - Clear cached data
8. **health_check** - Verify server status

## Next Steps

1. **âœ… FIXED**: Server communication is working
2. **âœ… READY**: Restart Claude Desktop to load the functions
3. **âœ… TESTED**: All MCP protocol communication is working correctly

## Key Lesson
When working with MCP servers, **never redirect stdout globally** in stdio mode, as this breaks the JSON-RPC communication protocol that Claude Desktop relies on for function calls.

The PyBaseball MCP server should now load successfully in Claude Desktop and provide baseball statistics functionality!
