# Step 1 Completion Summary: Treat Prompts as Code

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1.1 Semantic Versioning for Prompt Files
- [x] Renamed all prompt files with semantic versioning format (@x.y.z.md)
- [x] Added version headers to all prompt files
- [x] Established v1.0.0 as initial version for existing production prompts
- [x] Updated base-instructions to v1.1.0 (breaking change - slimmed down)

**Files Versioned:**
- `base-instructions@1.1.0.md` (updated from v1.0.0)
- `workflow-instructions@1.0.0.md` (new file)
- `confidence-guidelines@1.0.0.md`
- `response-format@1.0.0.md`
- `web-search-guidelines@1.0.0.md`
- `football/system-prompt@1.0.0.md`
- `baseball/system-prompt@1.0.0.md`
- `basketball/system-prompt@1.0.0.md`

### 1.2 Pull-Request Linting
- [x] Created `.github/workflows/prompt-lint.yml` for CI
- [x] Configured markdownlint with `.markdownlint.json`
- [x] Added semantic versioning format validation
- [x] Added version header validation
- [x] CI will fail if prompts don't follow standards

### 1.3 Snapshot Unit Tests
- [x] Created `backend/tests/test_prompts.py`
- [x] Added tests for critical prompt content sections
- [x] Added tests for proper semantic versioning
- [x] Added tests for version headers
- [x] Added tests for prompt loader functionality
- [x] All 9 tests passing ✅

## Updated Code Components
- [x] Updated `backend/app/services/prompt_loader.py` to use new file names
- [x] Added workflow instructions support to prompt loader
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility for existing API

## Verification Results
- ✅ All prompt files follow @x.y.z.md naming convention
- ✅ All prompt files have version headers (# Title vX.Y.Z)
- ✅ No unversioned prompt files remain
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ Prompt loader successfully loads all prompt types
- ✅ CI validation checks work correctly

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Version Control**: All prompt changes are now trackable with semantic versioning
2. **Quality Assurance**: CI prevents deployment of malformed prompts
3. **Regression Protection**: Unit tests catch breaking changes to critical prompt sections
4. **Team Collaboration**: Clear versioning enables safe parallel development
5. **Documentation**: Each prompt file clearly shows its version and capabilities

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed to **Step 2: Slim the System Prompt** - the foundation is now solid and maintainable.
