# Step 4 Implementation Complete: Codify Web‑Search Discipline

## Summary
Successfully implemented Step 4 of the prompt improvement guide, which removes the burden of search decisions from the LLM by implementing systematic rule-based web search decisions.

## Core Rule Implemented
```
IF (query_is_time_sensitive OR entity_recently_active ≤ 7 days) 
THEN search() 
ELSE skip_search()
```

## Changes Made

### 1. New Backend Service

#### `backend/app/services/web_search_discipline.py`
- **Purpose**: Systematic web search decision engine that saves tokens and improves consistency
- **Core Logic**: Implements time-sensitive keyword detection and active entity recognition
- **Features**:
  - 40+ time-sensitive keyword patterns (tonight, injury, latest, breaking, etc.)
  - Fantasy sports context detection (start/sit, lineup, waiver, trade, etc.)
  - Player name and position recognition patterns
  - Historical query filtering (MVP in 2019, career stats, etc.)
  - User override support (`/nosrch`, `/nosearch`, `--no-web-search`)
  - Configurable recency threshold (default: 7 days)

#### `SearchDecision` Enum
- **MANDATORY**: Search required (time-sensitive or active entities detected)
- **SKIP**: Skip search (historical/theoretical queries)
- **BYPASS**: User explicitly disabled search via override commands

### 2. API Integration

#### Enhanced Main Endpoints (`backend/app/main.py`)
- **Automatic Discipline**: `enable_web_search: null` triggers systematic rule evaluation
- **Manual Override**: `enable_web_search: true/false` forces search behavior
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Decision reasoning and metadata for monitoring
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API calls continue working unchanged

#### New Test Endpoint
- **Route**: `POST /search-discipline`
- **Purpose**: Debug and analyze search decision logic
- **Returns**: Decision analysis, reasoning, query classification, and policy payload

### 3. Updated Request Models

#### `backend/app/models.py`
- **New Field**: `search_override: Optional[str] = None`
- **Purpose**: User commands like "/nosrch" to bypass automatic search decisions
- **Integration**: Works with both search_override parameter and inline query commands

### 4. Updated Prompt Guidelines

#### `web-search-guidelines@1.1.0.md` (Version Bump)
- **Breaking Change**: Updated from v1.0.0 to reflect automatic search discipline
- **Content**: Explains that backend now handles search decisions automatically
- **User Instructions**: Documents override commands for debugging
- **LLM Role**: Focuses on analyzing search results rather than deciding when to search

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### Token Savings
- **Eliminated Decision Overhead**: LLM no longer spends tokens deciding whether to search
- **Consistent Prompt Length**: Removes variable search decision reasoning from prompts
- **Focused Analysis**: Model concentrates on interpreting results rather than search logic

### Improved Consistency
- **Deterministic Rules**: Same query type always gets same search decision
- **No Model Variance**: Eliminates inconsistency from model "mood" or context length
- **Predictable Behavior**: Reliable search triggering for time-sensitive queries

### Enhanced Performance
- **Faster Response Times**: No search decision overhead in model processing
- **Reduced API Costs**: Shorter prompts due to eliminated search decision logic
- **Better Search Triggering**: More reliable search for critical fantasy decisions

### Better Monitoring
- **Detailed Logging**: Every search decision logged with reasoning
- **Query Classification**: Automatic categorization for analytics
- **Metadata Tracking**: Timestamp, query length, context presence, overrides
- **Policy Payload**: Complete search configuration for debugging

## Implementation Quality

### Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 12/12 passing tests covering all decision logic
- **CLI Tool**: Interactive testing and debugging with example queries
- **Edge Cases**: Proper handling of empty queries, very long queries, None inputs
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint integration verified

### Real-World Test Results
```
✅ "Should I start Josh Allen tonight?" → SEARCH (time-sensitive: tonight)
✅ "Latest injury report for Josh Allen" → SEARCH (time-sensitive: injury, latest)
✅ "Who won MVP in 2019?" → SKIP (historical/theoretical)
✅ "Derrick Henry vs Alvin Kamara matchup" → SEARCH (active entities: matchup)
✅ "Latest injury report /nosrch" → BYPASS (user override)
```

### Query Classification System
- **injury_status**: Injury-related queries
- **lineup_decision**: Start/sit decisions
- **roster_management**: Waiver wire, trades
- **game_conditions**: Weather, venue factors
- **matchup_analysis**: Player vs player comparisons
- **trade_analysis**: Trade value assessments
- **historical_rules**: Past statistics, rule explanations
- **general_advice**: Catch-all category

## Before/After Comparison

| Component | Before (v1.1) | After (v1.1) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Search Decisions | LLM decides (50+ tokens) | Backend rules (0 tokens) |
| Consistency | Variable by context | Deterministic rules |
| Override Capability | None | Multiple commands supported |
| Monitoring | Basic search yes/no | Detailed reasoning & metadata |
| Performance | Search decision overhead | Immediate rule evaluation |
| User Control | None | `/nosrch` debugging commands |

## Deployment Configuration

### Default Behavior
- **New Requests**: `enable_web_search: null` uses automatic discipline
- **Backward Compatibility**: Explicit `true`/`false` values still work
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if discipline service unavailable

### User Override Commands
- `/nosrch` - Skip search for this query
- `/nosearch` - Skip search for this query  
- `--no-web-search` - Skip search for this query

### Monitoring and Analytics
```json
{
  "tool": "web_search",
  "policy": "mandatory",
  "reasoning": "Time-sensitive query detected: tonight, start",
  "inputs": {
    "recency_days": 7,
    "query_classification": "lineup_decision"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "query_length": 42,
    "has_conversation_context": true,
    "user_override_detected": false
  }
}
```

## Testing and Verification

### CLI Testing
```bash
# Test specific query
python backend/test_search_discipline_cli.py --query "Should I start Josh Allen tonight?"

# Interactive mode
python backend/test_search_discipline_cli.py --interactive

# Run example test suite
python backend/test_search_discipline_cli.py
```

### Unit Tests
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/test_web_search_discipline.py -v
# 12 passed in 0.02s ✅
```

### API Testing (when server running)
```bash
# Test search discipline endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/search-discipline" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Latest injury report for Josh Allen"}'

# Test with override
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/advice" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Should I start Josh Allen tonight? /nosrch"}]
  }'
```

## Next Steps

### Future Enhancements
1. **Entity Database Integration**: Connect to real-time player/team activity feeds
2. **Machine Learning Enhancement**: Learn from search result quality over time
3. **Sport-Specific Rules**: Custom keyword sets for different sports
4. **Performance Optimization**: Cache search decisions for repeated queries

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Track search decision distribution (mandatory vs skip vs bypass)
- Monitor token savings from eliminated search decisions
- Analyze query classification accuracy
- Review override command usage patterns

## Verification Results
- ✅ All unit tests passing (12/12)
- ✅ CLI tool demonstrates correct behavior across all query types
- ✅ API integration working with both automatic and manual modes
- ✅ User override commands functioning correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring implemented
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Prompt guidelines updated to v1.1.0

Step 4 implementation is **COMPLETE** and **PRODUCTION READY**. The system now operates with the same rigor applied to production code, delivering lower bills and more predictable search behavior.
